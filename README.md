# 2TDPN Stack

The 2TPN Stack consists of these mandatory technologies:

- Typescript
- Type-graphql (with graphql-codegen)
- Prisma
- Next.js
- Docker

These technologies should also be in the stack (but not required)

- Vitest (for unit and integration testing)
- Cypress (for e2e testing)
- React Query
- Windicss (for styling, better version of tailwind\*)

This is an implementation of this stack that uses all these technologies
